## Devlogs
### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

Navigating through Github and Unity was tough. There were so many words and the interface seemed overwhelming. I'm hoping that after this quarter, I can get used to the process and make a fun game out of it. Changing the scene by moving the cat and putting it on the green platform, as well as moving the camera into first-person of the cat was really fun.

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
