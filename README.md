Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

Navigating through Github and Unity was tough. There were so many words and the interface seemed overwhelming. I'm hoping that after this quarter, I can get used to the process and make a fun game out of it. Changing the scene by moving the cat and putting it on the green platform, as well as moving the camera into first-person of the cat was really fun.

### W2

r, g, b values are floats and not strings, bools, or ints because their values have decimal numbers.

_bounce variable is an int beacause its value is how many bounces there are and there cannot be a decimal value for it since there's no half bounce.

A semicolon was missing, so the statement couldn't finish.

### W3

I would put the parameters to be a int variable for the friendship level, and a bool variable for the flag of the character's secret. The return type would be a string variable for the dialogue of the character.
